Here is a part of an application for a company producing bricks.
Bricks are delivered in pallets (stacks of bricks).

The Pallet class is supposed to provide methods telling its height
and weight.

There are (at least) four errors in this project. Find them. Fix them.
Then discuss how you went about finding the errors. What strategies
did you employ?
