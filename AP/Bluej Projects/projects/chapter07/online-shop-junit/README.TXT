This project implements a small part of an online sales system (such as Amazon.com).
The current project is concerned only with customer comments for sales items. It contains
code to create, store, show and manipulate customer comments.

The purpose of this project is to introduce regression testing using JUnit. It includes 
a test class that demonstrates some of the testing functionality. Testing is further 
discussed in the book.

NOTE: There are several serious errors to be found in these classes.
