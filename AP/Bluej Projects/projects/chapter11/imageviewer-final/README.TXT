It is discussed in chapter 11.

This project demonstrates the building of a simple GUI (including labels, 
buttons, layout managers, event handling, menus, dialogs) as well as a bit of 
image processing.

This project is started by creating an object of class ImageViewer. This will 
automatically display the application's GUI - no further interaction with the 
object on the object bench is necessary.

WARNING: 

It often happens (unfortunately) that the image viewer window opens BEHIND the
BlueJ window. This can be confusing, since it initially appears as if nothing 
is happening.
