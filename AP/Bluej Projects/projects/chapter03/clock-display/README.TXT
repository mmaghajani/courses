Project: clock-display

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class ClockDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as timeTick and setTime. Watch the 
"displayString" in the inspector.

The displayString field simulates the actual clock display device. Was this 
program running in a real clock, it would change the real, physical display 
hardware instead of this string. Everything else could be pretty much the same.

Note: This project does not implement adequate handling of errors.
