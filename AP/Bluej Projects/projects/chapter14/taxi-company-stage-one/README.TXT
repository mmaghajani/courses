This project provides a partial implementation of a simulation of
taxis operating on a city grid to pick up and transport passengers.
    
This is the third stage of this project. It illustrates the 
implementation of a first stage of the project.

How to start this project:
    Create a Demo object and invoke its demo method.
    A single taxi carries a single passenger to their destination.

The test classes provide a little testing of basic functionality.
